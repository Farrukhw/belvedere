<h1>Belvedere Log</h1>
<p>The 'Belvedere Log' dialog is displayed by clicking the 'View Log...' option within the 'File' Menu.  The user is then presented with the dialog box below.</p>
<img src="images/dialog-log.JPG"><br /><br />
<p>The majority of this dialog box is used to display the contents of the log file, with the most recent log entry being at the very bottom of the list.  The following buttons are also available to the user:</p>
<a href="#refresh">Refresh</a><br />
<a href="#clear">Clear Log</a><br />
<a href="#save">Save Log...</a><br />
<hr />
<a name="refresh"><h2>Refresh Button</h2></a>
<p>The refresh log button will refresh the current screen with the newest log entries.  The screen will not auto refresh after each log entry, so it must be refreshed manually.</p>
<a href="#top">Top</a><br />
<hr />
<a name="refresh"><h2>Clear Log Button</h2></a>
<p>The clear log button will irreversibly clear the application log file.</p>
<a href="#top">Top</a><br />
<hr />
<a name="refresh"><h2>Save Log... Button</h2></a>
<p>The save log button allows users to save a copy of the current log file to another filename or directory of their choosing.  This will not remove the current log, but rather make a copy of the current log and also keep it as the active log.</p>
