<h1>Belvedere Automated File Manager</h1>
<p>Belvedere is an automated file managment application that performs actions on files based on user-defined criteria. For example, if a file in your downloads folder hasn't been opened in 4 weeks and it's larger than 10MB, you can tell Belvedere to automatically send it to the Recycle Bin.  Belvedere is written by Adam Pash and distributed by Lifehacker under the GNU Public License.
