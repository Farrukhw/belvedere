<h1>Create Rule</h1>
<p>The 'Create a rule...' dialog is displayed by pressing the '+' below the rule list box on the main program screen.  The user is then presented with the below dialog box.</p>
<img src="images/rule-create.JPG"><br /><br />
<p>The screen is divided into 4 sections:</p>
<a href="#settings">Rule Settings Area</a><br />
<a href="#subjects">Rule Subjects Area</a><br />
<a href="#verbs">Rule Verbs Area</a><br />
<a href="#buttons">Rule Buttons</a><br />
<hr />
<a name="settings"><h2>Rule Settings</h2></a>
<p>The top most part of the dialog box is where the user sets the overall rule settings.  Here the user is presented with the folder to which the rule is assigned, and allowed to create a description, or rule title.  Here the user can also apply the following rule options:</p>
<img src="images/rule-create-1.JPG"><br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Enabled</strong> - If checked, the specific rule will be applied, and potentially act upon, the files within the folder to which this rule is assigned.  This option is also displayed on the main screen in the left most column of the right side rule box.  A rule may be enabled/disabled from either location within the application.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm Action</strong> - If checked, a dialog box with be displayed, confirming the action(s) of the rule prior to executing these actions.  If a confirmation is activley being displayed, the program will essentially be 'paused' until user input is provided.  A user may either confirm or deny the actions of the particular rule in question.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive</strong> - If checked, the program will step through all the subdirectories of the folder to which the rule is assigned.  If left unchecked, the rule in question will only operate on files within the immediate folder, and will not step into folders deeper within the tree structure.</li>
</ul>
