<h3>Sleeptime</h3>
<p>The sleeptime setting is used to configure how often Belvedere will rotate through the folder and rules. After each process time, Belvedere will go to sleep for the specified period of time. Once this time period has passed, Belvedere will 'wake-up' and work through all the active rules for each folder.  Time periods are from the last program execution time and are specified in units of seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<h3>Exit Confirmation</h3>
<p>Belvedere will display a confirmation message by default when the user tries to exit the application.  This can be turned off, eliminating the need for confirmation, by removing the checkmark from this particular box.</p>

<h3>System Logging</h3>
<p>Belvedere is capable of logging all the actions within the system in 3 different forms:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System Events (System) </strong>- This option allows the user to log all activity within Belvedere with respect to option changes, rule creation/deletion/activation.</li>
<li><strong>System Actions (Actions) </strong>- this option allows the user to log all actions that Belvedere takes based upon the rules that are set up and active within the system.</li>
<li><strong>All System Occurrences (Both) </strong>- This option is a combination of both of the options listed above.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>System Events</dt><br />
<dd style="font-family: monospace">2009-04-28 10:38:00 Logging has been enabled with type: Both</dd><br />
<dd style="font-family: monospace">2009-05-01 03:28:06 SYSTEM Belvedere has been paused</dd><br />

</ul>
<p>Please note that Growl for Windows must be installed separately in order for this functionality to work.</p>

<a name="options"><h2>Default Rule Options</h2></a>
<img src="images/tab-prefs-3.JPG"><br />
<p>When creating a new rule, the Rule Options in the top right hand corner of the <a href="rule-create.htm">Create rule</a> dialog can be defaulted to checked/unchecked, depending on the options chosen in this section.  This setting will then apply to all newly created rules.</p>
<a href="#top">Top</a><br />

<a name="cmd"><h2>Command Line Parameters</h2></a>
<img src="images/tab-prefs-4.JPG"><br />
<p>Belvedere has the ability accept command line parameters to alter various settings of the application at runtime.  The following parameters and their values are currently accepted by Belvedere:</p>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt style="font-family: monospace">-r&nbsp;&lt;integer&gt;</dt>
<dd style="font-family: monospace">Specifies the number of times that you would like Belvedere to run and then exit quietly.</dd>
<dd style="font-family: monospace">Example:  Belvedere.exe -r 5  will result in Belvedere running through all rules 5 times and then exiting quietly.</dd> 
</dl>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:  All parameters and their corresponding values must be separated by a space in order to be accepted.  If any invalid parameters or values are entered, Belvedere will run normally without any settings modified.</p>
<p>If <em>System</em> logging is enabled, both the initial acceptance of the setting and the exit event will be recorded in the event log.</p>

<a name="verify"><h2>Verify Configuration</h2></a>
<img src="images/tab-prefs-5.JPG"><br />
<p>By clicking this button, Belvedere will both verify and correct basic errors within the rules.ini file.  This functionality is specifically used when the rules file is found to be corrupted or incomplete.  This verification should also be executed immediately following an application upgrade to ensure that the rules.ini file it upgraded to the most current release.</p>
